# Sudoku-Algorithm

**Sudoku!**
The goal of sudoku is to complete a square grid of 9×9 = 81 cells using only the numbers from 1 to 9, in a way that has exactly one instance of each digit appearing in each column, in each row, and in each 3 × 3 sub-square. For example, in Figure 1 the cell marked with the red circle must be a “7”, since every other possible value appears in at least one of the three sets (row, purple; column, blue; and sub-square, green) that cell is a member of. All of the other cells in the example can be determined using the same strategy.

Your task in this assignment is to develop a sudoku assistant, to help people solve their sudoku puzzles. You will
use a one-dimensional C array to store a linearized version of the sudoku matrix (see Figure 4), and will write functions that carry out useful operations, including checking for numbering violations, identifying any “it must be that value” cells, and perhaps even solving some easy puzzles through to completion.
